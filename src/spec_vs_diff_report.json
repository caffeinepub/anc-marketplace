  "summary": "The diff primarily addresses REQ-1 by forcing a light color scheme and setting a white/light background via global CSS, and it appears to configure the app’s ThemeProvider to default to a light theme. However, due to truncation in App.tsx, it is not fully verifiable that system theme following is disabled (which is required to guarantee light background regardless of OS dark mode). The diff also includes changes to project metadata files that were not requested.",

      "requirement": "Ensure all site pages render with a white (light) background instead of a black (dark) background, regardless of the user’s OS/system theme settings.",
      "reason": "App.tsx is truncated at the ThemeProvider configuration, so it cannot be confirmed from the provided diff summary that system theme detection is disabled (e.g., enableSystem={false}) and that dark mode cannot be applied automatically on devices with system dark mode enabled.",
