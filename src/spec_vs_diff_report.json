  "summary": "The diff implements a migration system and removes authentication checks from Admin Center queries, but does not fully address frontend authentication guard removal or backend method accessibility as specified in the requirements. Several required backend methods remain stubbed, and no evidence of Version 63 revert is present.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Revert the application deployment to Version 63",
      "reason": "No evidence of version revert in the diff. The migration.mo file is new (not from Version 63), and main.mo shows modifications rather than a revert to a previous version state.",

      "requirement": "Remove all Internet Identity authentication checks and guards that prevent access to the Admin Center page in the frontend",

      "reason": "While some query hooks were modified, multiple Admin Center backend methods remain stubbed (useGetPendingRoleApplications, useSubmitRoleApplication, useApproveRoleApplication, useRejectRoleApplication, useGetAdminCenterAnalytics returns stub warning). No evidence that backend methods themselves were modified to remove authentication checks.",
