  "summary": "REQ-1 is partially addressed via new menu-specific CSS tokens/classes and usage of a `menu-surface` class on at least one dropdown menu. However, the diff evidence is truncated and does not clearly show the same treatment applied to all required desktop dropdowns and the mobile slide-over (SheetContent). Additionally, several unrelated styling/product changes appear to have been introduced, which violates the request to keep changes limited to menu styling/readability and avoid broader theme/site changes or new routes/navigation.",

      "reason": "The diff snippet shows `DropdownMenuContent` for the Customer dropdown using `className=\"w-48 menu-surface\"`, but the file is truncated before showing Sellers & Businesses, Legal, and the authenticated user menu dropdown content classes. Cannot confirm they were updated.",

      "reason": "`SheetContent` is imported, and menu styling classes are defined in CSS, but the truncated Layout diff does not show `SheetContent` being given `menu-surface` (or equivalent) classes. Cannot confirm the mobile slide-over background/readability changes were applied.",
