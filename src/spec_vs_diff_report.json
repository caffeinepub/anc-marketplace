  "summary": "Branding appears updated to \"ANC Marketplace\" in several key frontend locations (header/banner, homepage hero, footer, index.html meta/title, manifest). A new seller payouts page/route and related React Query hooks were added. Policy/terms docs were updated to describe temporarily holding seller funds. However, the diff summary does not provide clear evidence that the backend seeded assistant knowledge base was updated (REQ-2/REQ-8), nor that the backend escrow ledger/payout/account-number/card-application storage+APIs are implemented (REQ-3/REQ-4/REQ-6). Also, the payouts page truncation prevents confirming the held-balance display and payout transfer listing requirements (REQ-5/REQ-7).",
