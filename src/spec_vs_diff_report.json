  "summary": "The diff shows modifications to backend/main.mo and frontend AdminCenterPage.tsx, but critical changes are missing. The backend file diff is truncated and does not show removal of authentication guards from admin functions. The frontend shows a timeout mechanism but no evidence of removing Internet Identity authentication checks. No preservation evidence is visible for existing data.",

      "requirement": "Remove Internet Identity authentication checks from AdminCenterPage.tsx that are blocking access to the Admin Center interface",
      "reason": "The AdminCenterPage.tsx diff shows only a timeout mechanism for actor creation, but does not show removal of Internet Identity authentication guards or checks that would prevent the 'Connecting to backend...' loading state. The component still appears to wait for actor initialization.",
