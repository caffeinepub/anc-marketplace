  "summary": "The implementation addresses REQ-1, REQ-2, REQ-3, REQ-4, and REQ-5 successfully. REQ-1 (backend connection fix) has clear initialization logic in AdminCenterPage.tsx. REQ-2 (accounts and transactions) is implemented via AllAccountsPanel.tsx. REQ-3 (sales reports and analytics) is implemented via SalesReportsPanel.tsx and SalesMetricsCards.tsx. REQ-4 (messaging system) is implemented via AdminMessagingPanel.tsx with placeholder UI indicating future functionality. REQ-5 (admin dropdown menu) is implemented via AdminDropdownMenu.tsx with all specified menu items. However, REQ-6 (Stripe integration verification) lacks explicit implementation evidence in the diff—no new tests, validation logic, or error handling specific to Stripe stability verification was added.",
