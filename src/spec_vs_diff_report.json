  "summary": "Layout.tsx was updated to introduce dropdown-based header navigation using TanStack Router navigation, with a visible start of a “Customer” dropdown and supporting mobile menu state. However, due to truncation, the diff summary does not provide definitive evidence that all required links (for both Customer and Sellers & Businesses) and the required site-wide Privacy Policy dropdown item are fully implemented and present on both desktop and mobile, nor that the footer Privacy Policy link remains unchanged.",

      "id": "REQ-35",
      "requirement": "Desktop header has a “Customer” dropdown including at least Store (/store), Customer FAQ (/customer-faq), Customer Blog (/customer-blog).",
      "reason": "The diff shows the Customer dropdown and a Store link, but the file content is truncated before showing whether Customer FAQ and Customer Blog links are included.",

      "reason": "The provided snippet does not show the Sellers & Businesses dropdown content (or its existence); truncation prevents verification of the required links.",

      "requirement": "The dropdown navigation is also available from the mobile menu (Sheet) so mobile users can reach the same pages.",
      "reason": "Although Sheet components and mobile menu state are present, the truncated diff does not show the actual mobile menu content/links to confirm parity with desktop dropdowns.",

      "requirement": "Add a site-wide dropdown menu option in the header navigation linking to /privacy-policy, visible regardless of authentication status and active role.",
