  "summary": "The diff successfully implements REQ-1 by hardcoding the Available Balance to $72,025.00 in FinancialOverviewCards.tsx. However, there is no evidence in the diff that REQ-2 (credit line display) and REQ-3 (preservation of other UI elements) were addressed, though these may have been unchanged rather than missing. The implementation uses a hardcoded value (7_202_500 cents) rather than deriving from financialState, which may be intentional given the BuildRequest constraints.",

      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Keep the $10,000 credit line separate and clearly displayed as spending credit (not withdrawable funds)",
      "reason": "No evidence in the diff that the credit line display logic was verified, updated, or preserved. The diff shows credit line rendering code exists, but without seeing the full implementation or test results, cannot confirm the '$0.00 used of $10,000.00 limit' display and visual distinction requirements are met.",

      "reason": "The diff only shows changes to FinancialOverviewCards.tsx. There is no evidence that the Payroll Savings card, Owner Withdrawals form, navigation tabs, or pending backend integration alert were verified or explicitly preserved. These components may exist elsewhere but are not shown in the truncated diff.",
