# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Fix Admin Center access control initialization and improve text visibility across the application.

**Planned changes:**
- Initialize backend access control with two Owner Admin principals (e6nnr-cosry-qkhze-ku7xv-mkip5-7r7jv-vzev3-rtopc-4na67-4flnw-oqe and jghzz-cnbjn-dw57n-z26cp-muyrx-mwdbf-xr3i7-y73da-5qlgr-kxe4h-4qe) and email (anc.electronics.n.more@gmail.com)
- Change hero section text "Our mission is your success" and "Explore Our Services" to bold white for visibility against dark background
- Add solid opaque backgrounds to all popups, dropdown menus, and modal overlays
- Review and enhance existing admin dashboard functionality (financial accounts, role assignment, access control)

**User-visible outcome:** Admin Center loads successfully without errors, hero section text is clearly visible in bold white, all dropdown menus and popups have solid backgrounds for readability, and admin dashboard operates with improved functionality.
