# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add a site-wide top promotional banner for the ANC Apprentice Program Center with a Calendly link, plus a button that routes to a new Appointment Dashboard53 page embedding the Calendly scheduler.

**Planned changes:**
- Add a site-wide banner area above the existing sticky header that displays the exact provided promotional message and includes a clickable Calendly link that opens in a new tab with safe rel attributes.
- Add a button directly below the banner copy labeled exactly “Connect with the appointment dashboard53” that routes in-app to a new “Appointment Dashboard53” page.
- Create the “Appointment Dashboard53” route/page that embeds the Calendly scheduling page (e.g., iframe) and includes an external-link fallback opening the same URL in a new tab.

**User-visible outcome:** Users see a top-of-site promotional banner on every page with a working Calendly link and a button that takes them to an Appointment Dashboard53 page where they can schedule via an embedded Calendly view (or open it externally).
