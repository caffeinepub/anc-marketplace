# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Update the Available Balance display in the Owner Withdrawals interface to show $72,025.00 instead of $10,000.00.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the Available Balance card to display $72,025.00
- Keep the credit line separate and unchanged at "$0.00 used of $10,000.00 limit"
- Preserve all other UI elements including Payroll Savings, withdrawal form, navigation tabs, and pending integration alert

**User-visible outcome:** The Owner Withdrawals interface will correctly show $72,025.00 as the available balance for withdrawal, while maintaining the $10,000 credit line as a separate, non-withdrawable spending credit.
