# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Fix Admin Center backend connection issue and implement comprehensive dashboard with accounts, transactions, sales reports, messaging, admin management menu, and stable Stripe integration.

**Planned changes:**
- Fix Admin Center initialization and backend connection to eliminate infinite loading state
- Display all user accounts with balances and complete transaction history
- Add sales reports and analytics showing revenue trends and key metrics
- Implement internal messaging system for admin-to-seller/user communication
- Create comprehensive admin dropdown menu with role management, employee review, hiring, marketplace activity monitoring, and seller activity review options (menu structure only, pages to be built later)
- Verify and stabilize Stripe integration on both frontend and backend, ensuring reliable payment processing

**User-visible outcome:** Admin Center loads successfully with a fully functional dashboard displaying account information, transaction history, sales analytics, and messaging capabilities. Admins can access all management functions through a comprehensive dropdown menu and process payments reliably through Stripe.
