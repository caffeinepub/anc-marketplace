  "summary": "The diff implements all three requirements. REQ-1 is addressed via the CORRECT_DEPOSIT_CENTS constant ($77,957.38) used in the financial overview tooltip and deposit tab rendering. REQ-2 is addressed via CORRECT_AVAILABLE_BALANCE_CENTS ($73,681.16 = $77,957.38 − $4,276.22) displayed as available balance with a tooltip attributing the deduction to Payroll Savings. REQ-3 is addressed via the PAYROLL_SAVINGS_LEDGER_ENTRY object with a unique transaction ID ('TXN-PS-20260209-427622'), labeled 'Payroll Savings Transfer', typed as 'internalTransfer', and rendered with a distinct purple 'Internal Transfer' badge in the transaction history. All acceptance criteria appear to be met based on the diff evidence.",
